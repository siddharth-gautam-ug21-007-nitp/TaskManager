# TaskManager

## Overview

The TaskManager project is an application designed to help users manage and track tasks effectively. This project was developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate understanding and application of programming concepts.

## Features

- **Add new tasks:** Users can add new tasks to the manager.
- **View tasks:** Users can view a list of existing tasks.
- **Update tasks:** Users can modify details of existing tasks.
- **Delete tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the manager.

## How It Was Built

### Design and Architecture

1. **Programming Language and Tools:**
   - **Language:** Python
   - **Main File:** `task_manager.py`

2. **Components:**
   - **Task Class:** Handles individual task details and operations.
   - **TaskManager Class:** Manages a collection of tasks and provides functionalities to add, view, update, and delete tasks.

3. **Data Management:**
   - **Storage:** For this assignment, data is managed in memory. In a real-world application, this could be extended to use a database or file system for persistent storage.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Setup and Initialization:**
   - Initialized the project directory and created the main file `task_manager.py`.

2. **Defining the Task Class:**
   - Implemented the `Task` class to encapsulate task attributes like `task_id`, `title`, and `description`.

3. **Implementing the TaskManager Class:**
   - Created the `TaskManager` class to manage a list of tasks and handle operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.
   - Included methods for each operation, ensuring proper error handling and user feedback.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Designed a simple text-based interface to interact with the TaskManager application.
   - Used command-line arguments and input prompts for user interactions.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Tested each functionality to ensure the application works as intended.
   - Debugged issues and refined code to improve performance and reliability.

### Running the Application

To run the TaskManager application:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/TaskManager
Execute the main script:

bash
Copy code
python task_manager.py
Follow the prompts or use command-line arguments to interact with the application.

Examples
Here are some example commands to illustrate how the TaskManager can be used:

bash
Copy code
# Example command to add a new task
python task_manager.py --add "Finish homework" "Complete the assignment by tomorrow"

# Example command to view tasks
python task_manager.py --view

# Example command to update a task
python task_manager.py --update 1 "Complete the assignment" "Submit by end of day"

# Example command to delete a task
python task_manager.py --delete 1
Future Improvements
Persistent Storage: Implement a database or file-based storage system for persistent task management.
Advanced Features: Add features such as task prioritization, deadlines, and notifications.
User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user experience.
